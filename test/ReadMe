Ideally, one produces tracks, where the Kalman Filter (KF) tracking algorithm 
is preferred to the RoadSearcher (RS) due to the use of pixel hits in KF and 
the unuse in RS, by 
> cmsRun TrackGen.cfg
and get the tracks in reco_ckfTrackCandidates.root. Then, one tests the 
SiPixelMonitorTrackResiduals module by 
> cmsRun SiPixelHitToTrackMon.cfg 
and get the residuals in SiPixelMonitorTrackResiduals.root.
